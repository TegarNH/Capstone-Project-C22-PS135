## About The Project
<div style="text-align: justify">Nowadays, people are becoming aware about their facial health. Especially about their facial problems, specifically, like their skin doesn't look healthy, have acne, and problem skin-related.There are many kinds of skincare products with many variants like products, ingredients, and usefulness. The problems are people find it hard to identify which one skincare product is right for them because there are so many problems related to facial skin. The people aware of the skin do not look healthy, have acne, or problem skin.<br/><br/>
Thus, there are chances that people don't use the skincare product wisely and suitable for them and only just make their facial problem more severe for themselves. Chances are high because sometimes people use skincare without consulting the professional, before. Mainly because of the high cost for them and  there is a lack of professional facial doctors who could resolve the problem in their regions or residence. Briefly to conclude, we need some automation tools that could meet human professional-like intelligence for resolving the problems without being needed to consult a professional facial-skin doctor.
